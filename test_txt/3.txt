Start by cleansing your face thoroughly with warm water to open up your pores completely.
Gently pat your skin dry with a clean towel, leaving it slightly damp for better absorption.
Take a generous amount of the face mask and spread it evenly across your entire face.
Use upward circular motions to massage the mask into your skin for maximum penetration.
Make sure to cover every area, including your forehead, cheeks, nose, and chin areas.
Avoid the delicate eye area and lips while applying this powerful treatment formula.
The rich, creamy texture glides smoothly over your skin, providing instant nourishment and hydration.
Feel the cooling sensation as the active ingredients begin to work their magic immediately.
Allow the mask to settle into your skin for the recommended treatment time period.
Relax and enjoy this luxurious spa-like experience in the comfort of your own home.
